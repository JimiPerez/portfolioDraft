        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I started working towards a tech career thinking that I would do something in Cyber Security. I went to college for Computer Science, but after my first Java class, I knew I wanted to work in programming. Coding is so fun. I love solving problems, though my favorite part of the experience was working with a team of other students to help eachother achieve a unified goal.</p>
        <h3>Some projects that I'm working on in my own time include:</h3>
<!--Unordered list-->
        <ul>
          <li>Website to document my cooking experience</li>
          <li>Website to document important news stories over time and by topic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Other than coding, I really enjoy spending time wood working. My most recent project was making and installing some questionable shelves in my kitchen as a nice accessable spice rack. It could be prettier, but I'm proud of it.</p>
